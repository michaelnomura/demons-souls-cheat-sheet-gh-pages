                <h3><a href="#">Boletarian Palace</a><span id="playthrough_totals_1"></span></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_1">1. Your starting position.
                        <ul>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_1_1_1">Behind you is some healing grass hidden behind the wooden palisades near the big gate.</li>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_1_1_2">In front of you are some Dreglings. Move forward slowly, looking left and right, to lure them out.</li>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_1_1_3">The gate to your left, down the small staircase, will open with Pure White or Black World Tendency for the Palace. Executioner Miralda is found out in this area.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_2">2. This open grate on the floor with swirling blue soul energy is a pitfall that spells certain death. Avoid it, or lure enemies here to kill them, including the Red Eye Knight.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_3">3. This room past the pitfall has a Dregling waiting to ambush you on the right side of the door. Another will come from further into the room, on the left side. A third is waiting at the far end of the second half of this room as you round the corner. Lure the first one outside, then block the other two and counter.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_4">4. There is a corpse behind the wooden support structure here. He has a Bastard Sword. You cannot get to him now, but remember this spot when the boulder trap is activated just above this point.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_5">5. There is a boulder trap at the top of this staircase. Look up and advance slowly. When the rock moves run back down or roll off the staircase. You can now drop down to the corpse at point 4 from here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_6">6. Top of the outer wall, your path branches three ways from here (four if you count dropping off the wall by the Blue Eye Knight to get the Light Crossbow).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_7">7. This leads to the very tough (for this early point in the game) Red Eye Knight. His shield and spear combo is very good, and will likely kill you in one hit. If you can kill him, he gives 2,000 soul and drops several Full Moon Grasses. He can also drop a Winged Spear or Purple Flame Shield. If you want to fight him, draw him back to the top of the wall around point 6 He'll get stuck on the catapults here. You can also lure him to his death at the stairwell past point 10, by getting him to fall off the side of the winding staircase. You'll want to clear the enemies from this stairwell anyway.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_8">8. The door to the mausoleum the Red Eye Knight is guarding can only be opened later in the game. It leads to the optional boss, Old King Doran. It can be opened if Ostrava of Boletaria (Prince Ariona Allant) dies in 1-1 or 1-4. Upon his death he drops a Mausoleum Key, and this key can open the mausoleum.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_9">9. This is the spot by the Blue Eye Knight (who is standing on the other side of the balcony not where the number is) where you can drop off the wall from the broken crenelations to land on the small terrace with the Light Crossbow and some Bolts. Be wary of the Soldier inside the wall from here. He is the guy who throws Firebombs down at you as you climbed the stairs earlier.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_10">Beyond this point is a room with a treacherous staircase leading down to a shortcut. At the bottom of it the Cling Ring (max HP in soul form raised to 75%) can be found. You can also trigger the Jade Hair Ornament and Old Raggedy Robes (light female robes with high Plague resistance) to drop outside point 12 along the way.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_11">10. This is a balcony about half way down the stairwell. Attack the chains on either side to drops two dead bodies, which will give you the Jade Hair Ornament, Old Raggedy Robes, and several Old Spices.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_12">12. Flip the lever here to open the small side gates, getting the Cling Ring and enabling your first shortcut.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_13">13. At the top you will encounter a Blue Eye Knight and behind him a fogged doorway. Walk through it and you will discover a way down.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(from this staircase, you can jump off and land on the rail leading to the platform with Ostrava and the Thief's Ring)<br>
                        <li>There are exploding barrels blocking your way into the hallway going to 14 The Soldier behind them will throw a Firebomb as you approach and try to kill you in the resulting blast.</li>
                        <li>Leave Ostrava alone for the moment and clear the enemies before the next fog gate. Once you reach the fog gate you can clear the lower level backwards. If Ostrava dies, you will miss out on a few of his goodies in later parts of the Palace, though he is heavily armored and will help you fight through the lower level. If he does die, be sure to pick up the Mausoleum Key. He won't walk past the fog gate, so it is safe to save him after you've killed all the enemies here.</li>
                        <li>Note: Keep in mind that, after saving Ostrava, if you leave this area and return to the Nexus without killing the Phalanx, all of the Dreglings, Soldiers, and Knights on Ostrava's patrol route will respawn upon your return. It's possible that Ostrava could be killed by the enemies, so if you need him alive, hurry back to him and help him kill the enemies when you return. Better yet, just kill Phalanx immediately after saving Ostrava.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_14">14. After beating the ambushing soldier from the left, and the halberd wielder in front of you, turn to the right and smash through these wooden palisades. The Dregling Merchant squatting inside this little room is friendly. He is your first merchant, and sells basic equipment and weapons. As you proceed north and then west, you'll come to a passage with a high wall on your left, a few foes will drop down while other enemies at the far north of the map will shoot at you from a platform structure. The next fog gate is at the top of the platform. Once you've cleared the area you can double back and go down to the lower level.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_15">15. See that wooden shack-looking thing in front of you? Attack it with your weapon to release a bunch of boulders. These will roll down the ramp and kill all the Soldiers and Dreglings along the way. Turnabout from point 5 is fair play, after all.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_16">16. The Dragon's Roost. Outside this door is a passage down to an open area, over which two dragons roost. These two can kill you in one hit. The Red Dragon with his fiery breath, and the Blue Dragon with his tail smashes. You want the Purple Flame Shield and Ring of Great Strength from here, but might want to wait for a bit.<br>Your options are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li data-id="playthrough_1_16_1">Advance to point 16 and trigger the Red Dragon's flame breath here, then sprint back to the roost and pick up the items before he returns. Drop off the side of the roost to the lower path to quickly escape if he does return.</li>
                        <li data-id="playthrough_1_16_2">Shoot the Red Dragon with arrows or spells until he flies away, which is a big waste.</li>
                        <li data-id="playthrough_1_16_3">Unlock 1-2 and kill the Red Dragon there, then return and he won't be here anymore.</li>
                        <li data-id="playthrough_1_16_4">Get White World Tendency in the Palace and both dragons will be gone.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_17">17. This walkway is crawling with Soldiers. If you advance forward the Red Dragon will show up and roast most of them alive, and you too if you remain on the walkway. Let him kill most of them, then return towards point 16 to lure him off the bridge and back to his nest. Then, sprint back here and towards the end. You'll want to roll through the crossbow bolts, to get across quickly before the Red Dragon can return. Refer to the notes at the start of the walkthrough for timing and other strategy suggestions.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_18">18. The lever here opens the main palace gate, unlocking the Phalanx boss. Also, the map doesn't show it with a number, but check for items in the side area just before the room with the lever, and loop around to the unopened wooden door.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_19">19. This lever opens the side gates on this side, becoming another shortcut. You'll also fight some Hoplites on your way towards this lever. The Phalanx boss is a giant slime with minions like these. The shield on their front blocks a percentage of received damage, so try to attack them in the back. When their spear appears, they can shoot it at you or poke you with it so keep up your guard.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_20">20. This fog gate, opened with the lever at point 18 leads to the Phalanx boss. If this is your first time playing, you might want to return to The Nexus to repair your armor or stock up on a few healing items, Firebombs, or Turpentine.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_1_21">21. The Phalanx boss battle.</li>
                </ul>

                <a name="Phalanx Archstone"></a>
                <h3><a href="#">Phalanx Archstone</a><span id="playthrough_totals_2"></span></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_1">1. The Phalanx Archstone serves as the starting point of this zone.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_2">2. It's dark in here so keep your eyes open as there are six <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/hoplite">Hoplite</a> located in this room. Drop down this side staircase to say hi to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> again, assuming you didn't let him die in <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-1">1-1</a>. He asks for your help with clearing out the tunnel behind him.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_3">3. Outside, you'll travel along the Lord's Path, a bridge connecting the two main structures of the Palace.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>See those zones marked with red arrows? That is where the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-2-dragon">Red Dragon</a> will fly by, breathing fire on you.
                        <li>Check for safe zones before getting ready to run across, and be sure that you are chasing the Dragon right after he passes overhead, instead of waiting for him to finish before moving. Otherwise, it'll make a second pass and burn you before you can make it to the first guard tower.</li>
                        <li>Do not stop to pick up any of the items that you see. Keep in mind that taking off enough equipment so that you will go below 50% equip burden will make you sprint and roll faster.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_4">4. The first guard tower. Climb to the top, facing the Spear Soldier and Axe Soldier along the way, then the two Crossbow Soldiers, to get the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/wooden-catalyst">Wooden Catalyst</a>. You can also kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-2-dragon">Red Dragon</a> from up here. You can grab a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/winged-spear">Winged Spear</a> and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/spiked-shield">Spiked Shield</a> from dead corpses along the flame routes at different points of the Lord's Path, after the Dragon is dead.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_5">5. Going down the side staircase of the tower leads you inside the pathway. Turn toward your left to rescue <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a>. (Point 6), being wary of Soldiers along the way, or right to approach the pack of Dogs and second guard tower.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_6">6. Assuming that you didn't die in the hail of crossbow bolts, you can rescue <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> here. He'll hand over some Dark Moon Grasses and begin his patrol.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can also pick up a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-gash-resistance">Ring of Gash Resistance</a> along the way. Turn around and work your way back towards Point 7.
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that, after saving <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a>, if you leave this area and return to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/nexus">The Nexus</a> without killing the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-2-boss">1-2 boss</a>, all of the Soldiers on <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava's</a> patrol route (from his initial position to the top of the first guard tower) will respawn upon your return. It's possible that <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> could be killed by the soldiers, so if you need him alive, help him kill the soldiers again when you return.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_7">7. As you approach this spot, a pack of Dogs will attack you. If you have a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> equipped, they won't notice you right away.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smash the wooden palisade and walk forward slowly, pressing R3 to attempt a lock-on. Once you lock onto one of them, use a spell, or arrow, or one of your free <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables">Throwing Knives</a>, to grab that particular dog's attention. Back up, keeping your shield raised, and attack after the dog rebounds off the shield. Repeat until they die. If you don't have that ring, the pack will descend upon you. Rush back to the first guard tower, corralling them in the doorway there. Though, if you're careful about edging towards the dog's you can still lure 1-2 dogs at a time without requiring the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_8">8. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dregling-merchant">Dregling Merchant</a> has relocated here, now that you have beaten the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-1-boss">Phalanx</a>. If you have a Strength-oriented melee character, consider purchasing the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/claymore">Claymore</a> here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_9">9. The second guard tower. A bunch of Crossbow Soldiers guard the front entryway, so be wary if you are running from the Dragon up here. If you climb to the top, sprint all the way to avoid the Crossbow Soldier ambush above your head. You get a bow and some arrows up here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_10">10.Notice the spot where the Dragon's breath reaches and doesn't reach. The Dregling behind the Palisade is a good marker. Stand there when waiting for the Dragon to pass overhead, then immediately sprint after it once the flames are a few feet in front of you. You might want to prepare some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables">Turpentine</a> on your weapon before running though. There are multiple Crossbow Soldiers and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-eye-knight">Blue Eye Knights</a> waiting for you at the end of the path. You don't want to be in a prolonged battle with them without anywhere to retreat, though you can use a wagon there for partial cover from their bolts.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_11">11. This is the group mentioned in point <strong>10.</strong> There are two Crossbow Soldiers high up on the wall, shooting down at you, and three more in front of you. There are two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-eye-knight">Blue Eye Knights</a> behind that second group, one close and another guarding the tunnel ahead of you. Hopefully, you've put some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables">Turpentine</a> on your weapon and swept the Crossbow guys clear in one or two swings. For the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-eye-knight">Blue Eye Knight</a>, I hope you practiced on the ones in <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-1">1-1</a>. Remember to keep moving and remain wary of the two up on the walls shooting down at you.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_2_12">12. There is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> here in this room. If you have a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> equipped, and I almost always wear one, you can sneak up on it and dash around the corner to attack it. Otherwise, it is already gone half the time you arrive in this room. Climb up further to get some payback on the two Crossbow Soldiers shooting down at you. Check around for multiple items up here, be sure to smash the wooden palisades as you search, but be wary of the open pitfall.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="#">Tower Knight Archstone</a><span id="playthrough_totals_3"></span></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_1">1. Your starting position for this map, the Tower Knight Archstone. The door ahead will remain locked until you destroy an Archdemon (the final boss of another world), so go do so if you haven't already. Enter the courtyard area. Watch out for the two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dogs">Dogs</a> in this area while you relieve the fallen soldiers of their souls. Note the gate in the upper right hand corner, this will become important later.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_2">2. As you climb this staircase, a soldier will spring a trap and send flaming balls down at you. Hide in the corner marked by 2 on the map to avoid it completely.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_3">3. As you reach Point 3, a scene will trigger and the gate ahead will close. As you proceed up the stairs, remember the level's only <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> on a porch to the right. The first time you approach, three Soldiers will burst out of the alley. Take them out and head up to the newly closed gate to grab a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a>. Return to Point 3 and make a left into the alleyway.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two Soldiers will be patrolling this area, one in a square just outside the alleyway, and another up and down the stairs. Lure the Soldier patrolling the square out into Point 3 and engage him. Once he's dead, go for the Soldier patrolling the stairs. Because he lacks a shield, he's easy pickings for your bow. After he's taken care of, notice the open ledge at the top of the stairs. This is the perfect spot to pick off the Crossbow Soldier at Point 4. You can also drop down to find an item, but leave that for now.</li>
                        <li>
                            First go down the stairs and you'll come across a new enemy, an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a>. Lure him up into the square, as he's very dangerous in tight quarters. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> can attack quickly with a dagger or throw knives from afar. Watch his attacks carefully and <strong>only</strong> attack when he's stunned to save yourself some hurt. Once he's down, head downstairs. Right before leaving the tunnel that the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> was waiting in, look to your left and break through the wooden cart/shelves to retrieve some treasure. Be careful as you move out into the open towards the ladder ahead. There is an archer located high above back over your right shoulder. He may not see you if you have your <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> on. Just in case, quickly climb up the ladder to find an alcove that you can safely snipe from.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_4">4. Keep your shield up as you enter Point 4.
                        <ul>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_3_4_1">There is an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> on the stairs in the Southeast corner. Another thing to note about these enemies is that they're often equipped with a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a>, only making them visible when you come close. Observe the flaming ball positioned at the top of the stairs, run up the stairs a little to trigger it's descent and then run back down to dodge it. Go back up the stairs and enter the first side alley on your left. An <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> will be waiting, so lure him back to the open area at the bottom of the stairs and take him out normally.</li>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_3_4_2">Now enter the first side alley on your right to find another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> who is backed up by a lone Crossbow Soldier at the end of the alley. Repeat the previous method to take out the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> and then deal with crossbow guy. Keep moving up the stairs and enter the last side alley to find an item . As you procure your prize (a mere <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/slaves-shield">Slave's Shield</a>) an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> will drop behind you, blocking your escape route. Fight him, but be very cautious as you're in such a tight space. Finally, kill the Soldier at the top of the stairs to reach Point 5.</li>
                        </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_5">5. This is where things get troublesome.
                        <ul>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_3_5_1">You'll notice three Crossbow Soldiers on a ledge ahead of you. There should also be a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> hanging out with them. Take them out from the stairs in the alleyway and not out in the open, lest you receive a nasty surprise. That surprise is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red Eye Knight</a> lurking in the building to your right along with two Soldiers.</li>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_3_5_2">Try to lure the Knight out and not the Soldiers, as the Knight will require all your attention. If you encountered the Knight in 1-1, let me remind you that you do <strong>not</strong> want to get hit by any of his attacks. Play defensively and only attack when he's stunned or trying to heal, and you should be fine. Now lure the Soldier out of the building and take him out. As you enter the building, watch out for a second Soldier lurking just to the right. Thwart his attempts and move up the stairs ahead to find a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dregling-merchant">Dregling Merchant</a> and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/great-sword">Great Sword</a> just outside the door. </li>
                            <li data-id="playthrough_3_5_3">This ledge is a good sniper perch to take some health off the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> (given that he's still there). This will make your life easier later. Once you're done, head back downstairs and proceed through the fog door on the left.</li>
                        </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_6">6. Use extreme caution here, as inside the long hallway is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red Eye Knight</a> wielding a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/claymore">Claymore</a> with both hands. This Knight is exponentially more dangerous than the others, so lure him out into an open area like Point 5 before engaging. Your shield is practically useless against him as if you block his attack he'll catch you in a stun lock and kill you if you don't roll away as fast as possible. He'll usually attack twice or three times in succession before recovering, so strike after he stops attacking. Once your powerful rival is pushing up daisies, proceed to Point <strong>7</strong>.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span style="color: green">Tip</span> You can kill this <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knight</a> without going through the green fog, if you have a decent bow. He patrols back and forth from the green fog, down the hallway, and out the door across the gap. You can either shoot him when he comes out the far door, or you can shoot him through the windows as he walks down the hallway. If you go for the window method (which will do more damage as he is closer) then fire an arrow past him so he hears the noise and stops. This makes him an easier target.</li>
                        <li><span style="color: green">Tip</span> If you have the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/god-s-wrath">God's Wrath</a> miracle, you can kill the Knight from the other side of the fog. Stand right in front of the fog and wait for the Knight to reach your end of the hallway, then cast the spell. If the fog is already open, just hide around the corner, where he can't see you, and watch for his approach. If your Faith is high enough, one blast will kill him.</li>
                        <li><span style="color: green">Tip</span> If you have a long weapon (the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/uchigatana">Uchigatana</a> is splendid) walk all the way up to the fog without entering. When the Knight sees you on the other side of the fog he'll walk up to you and stare. Walk backwards until he begins moving towards you. Once he hits the fog he'll stop, now you can move up to the fog and do a strong (L2/R2 whichever hand you use) attack with your long weapon and it will hit him through the fog. Be careful. He may attack, and because of the length of his weapon, you can be hit. The fog will hold him back, but you should evade or step back quickly after your attack through the fog.</li>

                        <li><span style="color: green">Tip</span> <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/poison-cloud">Poison Cloud</a> also makes this a very easy kill.</li>
                        <li><span style="color: green">Tip</span> If you fall down to the ledge below (to the right of the first fog gate). Make sure you hop over the <strong>middle</strong> of the low ledge to proceed. Hopping over either <strong>end</strong> of the ledge, increases the risk of getting stuck in mid air as you hop over. You will be forced to reload your game if you do get stuck.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_7">7. There's an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> lurking in wait here, as well as the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> from earlier. Take out the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> first then move to the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a>. He moves and attacks slowly, but will make your life rather miserable if he gets a hit off. He also has a load of health. Whittle him down to nothing and relieve him of his <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/iron-ring-of-keys">Iron Ring of Keys</a> before moving on. A myriad of foes awaits you on the next landing, including Crossbow Soldiers, Regular Soldiers, and an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a>. Take out the Crossbow Soldiers on the right first and the Spy when he appears, then finish off the Regular Soldiers. By now this should be simple.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continue onward along the walls to find another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knight</a> wielding a two-hander. Ouch. Take him out as before, but be careful, as it would be a shame if your journey ended here. Snipe the Crossbow Soldiers across the bridge, kill the soldiers, and keep on keeping on.</li>
                        <li><em>Note</em>: The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/iron-ring-of-keys">Iron Ring of Keys</a> will be at the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> spawn point should you forget to pick it up before returning to the Nexus.</li>
                    </ul><br />

                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_8">8. This entire area is really more of the same. Note the side path that leads to an item, and just continue along the walls as usual to reach Point 9 on the map. On the right side of the wall, right over the gate, away from the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a>, you can jump down on the ridge above the gate to find a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/penetrating-sword">Penetrating Sword</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_9">9. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> that locked you out earlier is <em>still</em> here. One has to wonder what he's been doing all this time. Anyway, you can sneak up behind him and get a few hits on him. Kill him quickly though, as your good buddy <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> will be in need of help on the other side of the gate. Again. Once the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> is dead, take his sweet <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/official-s-cap">Official's Cap</a> and pull the lever to open the gate.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> has gotten himself cornered by two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knights</a> and a Soldier. Help him kill his adversaries. Once they're dead, <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> will thank you by giving you a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-quality">Pure Clearstone</a>. Sweet. And now that the gate's open you can easily return here without going through all that side alley silliness again.</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that, after saving Ostrava, if you leave this area and return to the Nexus without killing the 1-3 boss, most of the Soldiers on Ostrava's patrol route will respawn upon your return. It's possible that <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ostrava">Ostrava</a> could be killed by the enemies, so if you need him alive for his final appearance in 1-4 (or for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a> assassination quest), help him kill the Soldiers again when you return. Before we proceed, however, remember that locked door all the way back at Point 1? Head back there.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_10">10. Ostrava will retreat here if you save him. Talk to him to collect your <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-quality">Pure Clearstone</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_11">11. Use your <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/iron-ring-of-keys">Iron Ring of Keys</a> to open the locked door here, and move down into the dungeon area.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_12">12. Another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> will be waiting for you here. This one likes to shoot fire, so equip some fire defense. If you've been through Stonefang then this will be simple. Once he's dead, take his <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bloody-key">Bloody Key</a>. Down the hallway, just past Point 11, there's a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a>. At the very end of this tunnel you'll find a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/tower-shield">Tower Shield</a> (weight 30). There are items scattered around in some of the cells here, so use your <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/iron-ring-of-keys">Iron Ring of Keys</a> to open them.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_13">13. One of the cages, however, contains a very helpful ally. Meet <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/biorr">Biorr, of the Twin Fangs</a>. While he's inclined to continue napping for now, he'll be of great assistance against some of the later bosses of this world. From here however, we're not done freeing people just yet. Leave the dungeon and return to the iron door at Point 13.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_14">14. Use your <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bloody-key">Bloody Key</a> on this door to find&#8230;more alleyways! This is a relatively uneventful trip, aside from the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a> in one of the side areas. Move along to Point 15.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_15">15. The first thing you'll likely notice is the laughing of a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a>, as well as some items off to the side. You can get the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-the-accursed">Ring of the Accursed</a> and the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-magical-nature">Ring Of Magical Nature</a> here. Grab them and don the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/official-s-cap">Official's Cap</a>. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> above will lower the stairs for you. He won't be hostile until you take off the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/official-s-cap">Official's Cap</a> or attack him, so feel free to backstab him.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_16">16. <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/yuria">Yuria, the Witch</a> waits here to be rescued. Take off the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/official-s-cap">Official's Cap</a> as she won't take too kindly to you with it on. After talking with her, she'll tell you to go on ahead while she rests and escapes to the Nexus. Now that we've finished this little sidequest, it's time to move on with the level. Return to Point 9 and keep going to find a couple Soldiers to kill before reaching Point 17.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_17">17. This is another rough spot, but one that can be handled easily with a good strategy. You'll find all manner of Soldiers, as well as 3 (!!) <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eyed Knights</a> guarding a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a>. First, snipe all of the Crossbow Soldiers with arrows, and lure out the Regular Soldiers one at a time with them. When they're all dead, move forward for a quick scene as the Fat Official escapes.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Now the only things remaining are those three menacing <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eyed Knights</a>. The stairway is wide so running around them is always an option. If you want to fight the best strategy here is to equip the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> so they don't all try to come after you at once, and use arrows to lure each of them out, one at a time. By now you should have had some solid experience dealing with <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eyed Knights</a>, so they shouldn't be too much of a hassle. Once, they're gone, proceed up the stairs to the final fog door.</li>
                        <li><span style="color: green">Tip</span> Head back all the way to the main staircase and up towards the location for the Primeval Demon spawn. Head to the upper walkway of that platform, towards the location where the Unknown Hero's Soul is. Walk towards the edge until just before you walk off. From there you can snipe every enemy (including the three <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eyed Knights</a>) with any bow. Once each enemy gets close they'll start pathing into the wall and become easy prey for a lock-on bow killing.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_18">The final fog door. Not much else to say. Mentally prepare yourself and enter.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_3_19">The demon boss. See the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-3-boss">Penetrator</a> link for more information.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_2">2. There will be a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> behind them. Make sure to kill it before proceeding. Just beyond the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> you will see 3 Black Phantoms ahead.
                        <ul>

                            <li>There are a few spots in the game where you can use/exploit the game engine to your advantage. You'll notice the disk access icon appears as you come in the vicinity of an Arch Stone. It appears that the area the Arch Stone is in acts like an invisible &quot;zone line&quot;, where the next area is being loaded/streamed. You can pull enemies, such as the three Black Phantoms just beyond the dead dragon towards an Arch Stone and they will hit an invisible wall. Enemies can still attack and lunge at you from this point, but they will never be able to pass this invisible &quot;wall&quot;. Use your favorite weapon to dispatch them, but ranged attacks would work best.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively each can be lured alone by arrows and easily dispatched, using a good shield for the penatrator and bow user. Try to dodge and backstab the scraping spear phantom, as he will break your armour and weapons in a few hits so it is best to use his slow movement to your advantage. Pack back up weapons if you find the phantom has broken all your equipment. A very effective strategy is to stay a distance from him and keep casting Soul Arrow or Soul Ray. Remember to carry some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fresh-spice">Fresh Spice</a> or <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/old-spice">Old Spice</a>. Once killed they do not respawn until your next new game.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_3">3. Down the alley to the left, there is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a>. As you continue down the hallway to the right there will be another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> hiding (behind the 4th set of wooden palisades) partway down the alley as you head to Point <strong>3</strong>. Use arrows to break the palisades down. That will not alert the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a>, and you will have a clear shot at him. If you alert him, he will run towards the doorway where the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knight</a> is waiting inside the short hallway point <strong>3</strong>, so be careful in your pursuit.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_4">4. Be prepared for a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knight</a> waiting on the stairs to your right, as you exit the short hallway between Point <strong>3</strong> and Point <strong>4</strong>. Have your shield raised, as there are Crossbow Archers waiting above at Point <strong>4</strong>. Lure the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knight</a> and kill him outside first, and then proceed with killing the others.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_5">5. An <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/imperial-spy">Imperial Spy</a> waits to ambush you as you climb the stairs. At the top of the 4th flight of stairs you will find another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/red-eye-knight">Red-Eye Knight</a> without a shield. You'll hear him breathing before you see him. Without the thief ring on, this Knight may be alerted and jump you while you are killing off the crossbowmen and Spy, so be alert to his clunking footsteps on the stairs.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_6">6. At the top of the stairs, through the doorway, you will see a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> in the middle of the crosswalk. As you pass through the doorway a cut-scene will show the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-4-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> fly in and perch himself above the crosswalk. You'll see the second <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> at the other end of the crosswalk. Walk a little and wait for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> to breathe fire, and the first <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fat-official">Fat Official</a> will be killed by the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a>. From the doorway you can lure the second with arrows and draw him into the fire also. Or, just kill him with arrows. From here, you can either rush across or you can start ranged attacks on the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> (highly suggested). If the Blue Dragon’s life is reduced to half, it will fly away and perch above the castle entrance. You will encounter a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> as you approach the far doorway. His tail is visible just behind some barrels.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_7">7. If <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/biorr">Biorr</a> is still alive, he will be fighting against the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk1-4-dragon">Blue Dragon</a>.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you wish to get Biorr’s items, you can let the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> kill <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/biorr">Biorr</a>.</li>
                        <li>There are several ways to defeat the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a>. You can snipe the Blue Dragon’s head from afar but it will be challenging. If you can find the safe spot in the middle, you can also snipe the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> from there. You can also cast <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/water-veil">Water Veil</a> then run fast and avoid the Blue Dragon’s fire. Once you are below the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> (exactly at the castle entrance), you can start firing at the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blue-dragon">Blue Dragon</a> until it’s defeated (use lock on).</li>

Talk to him and he will give you the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/mausoleum-key">Mausoleum Key</a>. At this point he will appear as a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-rune-sword">Black Phantom</a> on the bridge ahead. While fighting the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-rune-sword">Rune Sword Black Phantom</a>, make sure not to fall since the sides are wide open. Lure him out and back down the stairs so that you're not fighting him on the catwalk. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-rune-sword">Rune Sword Black Phantom</a> will drop the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/rune-sword">Rune Sword</a> and the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/rune-shield">Rune Shield</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_4_9">9. Once done, proceed through the elevator. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/false-king">False King</a> will be waiting at the top.

                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_1">1. Your starting point, climb the stairs to proceed.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_2">2. Look for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/filthy-man">Filthy Man</a> sitting here, he is a merchant. Note the currently inoperable elevator behind him. This will lead you to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blacksmith-ed">Blacksmith Ed</a> once reactivated. To your left is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a>, and a Soul further down the path. Be wary of several falls in this area. Be wary of false messages here as well; do not attempt to jump down anywhere near here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_3">3. Watch the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> throwing rocks down on you from here. You can shoot the one on the left with one of your arrows. He won't die, but he <em>will</em> turn around and stop throwing boulders down at you. Also, I hope you read the permanent developer-placed messages telling you that thrust attacks and magic damage are potent against these guys. There is an item to the left here, behind some breakable objects. But be careful as the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> can adjust their aim and hit you there.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_4">4. Note the lever here to activate this side elevator. Riding to the top you will face a Fat Official and those two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a>. Pick up the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-crushing">Crushing</a> Battleaxe +1 up here if you are a Strength-oriented melee player. Ride the elevator down to pick up a Stone of Ephemeral Eyes. Note that purple enemy location, this is the Primeval Demon for Stonefang Tunnel (requires Pure Black World Tendency here to appear). Stay alert as you move through the tunnel connecting these two large chambers.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_5">5. Some dogs will bust through the yellow pottery as you approach this room, so be ready. Inside there is another Fat Official guarding some Ore. You can trade shots with him from outside of the room, sidestepping his projectiles. Be wary of the tunnel to the right, as a Pickaxe wielding <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> is waiting to ambush you.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_6">6. Two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> at the top of these small stairs. The second is waiting to ambush you from the little doorway to the right, so be ready for him. Just keep your shield raised at all times and be attentive. You can get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/pickaxe">Pickaxe</a> of your own from a side room here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_7">7.This gate is locked and will need to be opened with a nearby lever. Note the Fat Official on the wooden platform here. He will shoot at you as you run around. If you approach him on the bridge, it will collapse, depositing you below so that you can head towards the lever. You can also cross the broken bridge by running along the length of the left plank support rail. Be sure to pick up the items littering this area. There is a developer-placed white phantom that pulls the lever when you look at it.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_8">8. This is the lever, as stated above, a developer-placed white phantom will pull the lever to mark its location as you search for it. Be on the look out. You can also pick up some of Ed's Grindstones by smashing through some rubble south of the lever, by the two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> poking around nearby.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_9">9. Your first sighting of the Fire Lizards. You can also find your one and only free Meltstone here (reduces weapons to base level, losing all applied ore).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_10">10. There is a lava pit here. Please do not try to run through, as you will die. You'll put out the lava with a switch further ahead. Also, note the side area with the mass of Fire Lizards. Knock them off the walls with ranged attacks and then claim the Shard of Dragonstone that they guard. Also, push past the fog gate here and smash the wagons to head outside.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_11">11. Hopefully you passed that fog gate, smashing up the wagons along the way, and ended up outside. Enjoy the view for a moment. Turn left, grab the item, then come back and head right. Pull the lever here to activate the elevator. Rhythm is needed to ride the elevator safely, do not roll or run through the elevator as you might fall. This new shortcut to ground level also leads down to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blacksmith-ed">Blacksmith Ed</a>. He is the best blacksmith in the game, and necessary to make elemental weapons or Demon Souls-derived weapons. Try your best not to make him mad. Also, note the body on the small wooden platform halfway up the elevator holding an item.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_12">12. Does this stairway look familiar? Can you guess what might happen at the top of it? Yes, another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> ambush. From here head through their crude workshop, being on the lookout for the items here. As you go outside, you might notice a walkway with a wooden plank leading to several items. This plank breaks when you go across it. So sprint at full speed to get the items. You'll get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/great-club">Great Club</a> and some Souls for your trouble. Then drop down and backtrack to Point <strong>12</strong>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_13">13. First, when you come out of the foundry, to your left a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> will appear here just around this corner. So as not to disturb it, turn to your right. I think it's easier to attack this <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> by turning to your right, smashing through the barrels, and proceeding up the hidden stairs through Point <strong>14</strong>. If you do go left, know that there are large <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> behind this gecko. The two without weapons will throw boulders at you as you approach. You can snipe them if you wish, then fight the guys with the weapons. Again, I suggest you turn around and smash through those barrels behind you and take the hidden staircase which goes to Point <strong>14</strong> so you can attack them from behind.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_14">14. This area is directly above those <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a>. Grab the Grasses up here, then head to the far end. You can drop on the small raised platform here for a Soul. Then drop again for the Steel Shield, a basic large shield. Now you are behind those rock throwers, and can sneak away, or fight them. Use arrows or magic to dispatch them taking note of the Crystal Lizard on the other side. Take it out with arrows and collect its valuable ore.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_15">15. You'll have to trek to this Point to activate the lever to put out the lava pit. Some things to watch for along the way: 1) The Fire Lizards on that tower. Shoot the visible ones from far away to knock them down and fight them one or two at a time. Then very carefully proceed around the tower in a counter-clockwise motion. There will be a Fire Lizard ambushing you at the first corner, but this path lets you get the drop on 2 that would ambush you at the opposite corner by the item set as a trap for you. 2) There are some more Dogs as you climb down from the tower. They might run up the ramp, or can snap you through the ground as you walk down the ramp yourself. Be prepared for either case. 3) As you reach this ground floor, there are quite a few Pickaxe carrying <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> waiting to ambush you. Be ready for them, and collect the Soul down here. Now pull that lever to put out the lava, then drop down and backtrack.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_16">16. Now at the depleted lava pit you can cross safely. Be sure to check that side area on the left for a Ring of Poison Resistance. You also get some Ore and Grasses here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_17">17. There is a Fat Official here in a room PACKED with exploding barrels. To go forward blindly is suicide. You can: bait his attacks to clear some of the barrels, snipe him from halfway up the stairs, or break some barrels yourself then proceed down. The right half of the room is fairly safe. Use the pillars to block his attacks. After you beat laughing boy, check the next area on your right for a Stone of Ephemeral Eyes.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_18">18. There is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> way above the path who wants to drop a rock on your head. But luckily for you, assuming you slowed down to look at the webbing around you, he is a numbskull and drops his boulder far too early, then drops down and damages himself. Kill this fool and proceed casually.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_19">19. Apparently there is a glitchy spot here where you might get stuck. Try not to climb on weird scenery here.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_20">20. This elevator leads you to the Armored Spider boss. Before that though, go around behind it for some Spiderstone. Also, climb the wooden walkway and follow it around for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/kris-blade">Kris Blade</a>. This nifty item acts like a Ring of Magical Sharpness, buffing your magic spell attack power while lowering your magic defense. Hold it in the opposite hand of your Catalyst to use its bonus effect.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_5_21">21. First, before heading through the fog gate, turn back around and head down that small tunnel for more Spiderstone. Proceed through the fog gate. See the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk2-1-boss">Armored Spider</a> link for more information.</li>
                </ul>

                <a name="Armor Spider Archstone"></a>
                <h3><a href="http://http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk2-2">Armor Spider Archstone</a><span id="playthrough_totals_6"></span></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_1">1. Now things get complicated. This is your starting point for this area. Please read Point <strong>2</strong> carefully in preparation for this level.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_2">2. The first thing you notice is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> in front of you. Do not approach him right away. Notice instead the Lizardman with the Pickaxe next to him. Shoot this guy with arrows from far away to pull him towards you. Then you can try hunting the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a>. I suggest rolling/sprinting and sweeping to his right, to keep him from proceeding down the right tunnel, which is trapped with <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a> and insect husks. But be cautious of the mine cart in the middle of the room with the ball of glowing orange light. This thing is like a proximity explosive. Note its appearance and be ready to see them free-floating later in the level. From this room, Point <strong>3</strong> assumes you went right (for the short path to the boss loaded with fatal pitfalls along the way, but the hangout spot of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scirvir">Scirvir</a>) and Point <strong>4</strong> onward assumes you went left (for the longer, relatively safe path that leads to a ton of treasure).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_3">3. The first obstacle is reaching Point <strong>3</strong>. The tunnel with insect husks is packed with <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scale-miners">Scale Miners</a>, including some Pickaxe carriers who rally the group to attack you. Ranged attacks or the shield-and-spear combo work well here. Alternatively, the gutsy can wear a Thief's Ring and sprint through the middle. As you drop down, you can grab a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-disease-resistance">Ring of Disease Resistance</a> and some Souls. But be wary of the drops. One false step, or slight clipping issue, and you will die. That narrow beam just holds a Soul, so feel free to ignore it if you aren't that confident. You really don't even need the Disease ring either, so drop along the right side to reach the Point safely. There are 2 <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizards</a> here. But they aren't the main attraction. With White Tendency, <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scirvir">Scirvir the Wanderer</a> will hang around here. Talk to him while having equipped the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dragon-bone-smasher">Dragon Bone Smasher</a> and he will give you a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-crushing">Pure Greystone</a>. With Black Tendency, <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scirvir">Black Phantom Scirvir</a> will hang around here, and kill you! (Please see <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/scirvir">Scirvir's wiki</a> for various strategies to fight him.) For beating such a tough enemy you get the awesome <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/talisman-of-beasts">Talisman of the Beast</a>. From here drop down further towards the bottom of the pit to proceed to the boss area. There is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> down here on a wooden walkway near the bottom. Skip to Point <strong>15</strong>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_4">4. Okay, so you want to take the long road and pick up a lot of treasure, lets go! There are three mine carts with a proximity explosive (glowing yellow ball). Two will roll towards Point <strong>2</strong>, one at a time, eventually stopping at the junction. It's safest to trigger these first. The third one will only start approaching when you're half-way into the tunnel. Stay to either side of the tracks and sprint past it.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_5">5. Without letting you rest, there is an Official hiding on the right side of this room. You'll need to deal with him first and foremost. By now you should be fairly experienced with these guys. Use ranged attacks, or quickly circle them with some form of fire defense enabled and attack between their attacks (Or simply use a spear &amp; skewer him as you remain on the opposite side of the wooden post immediately between you two). From here the map points get somewhat screwy. Please bear with me.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_6">6. This top area is part of a large rift that serves as a major portion of this level. If you walk forward to grab the Ore in front of you, a Rock Worm pops out of the ground and attacks you. Back away and use lock-on to target his mouth and deliver a critical attack to finish him off. Soul Arrow, regular arrows, or overhead swings from large swords all work this way. There is another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> to your left up here. Be careful about hunting it, to keep it or yourself from falling off the walkway. While there is some Ore directly beneath here that you can only get to by falling, the map Points assume you get them later. If you do drop down, be wary of your Item Weight when you reach the ramp below. There is a Great Axe here that weighs 10.0 units! If you drop it due to high inventory weight and leave, it is gone forever.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_7">7. The map assumes that you took the elevator down after exploring the top deck of the rift. This area is important for several reasons. The first time you arrive, you'll note the 2(!) Black Phantom barbarians using Great Clubs and Steel Shields. Use the tunnel behind you to hide from them. Then try to draw one out and fight him. Together they can break your guard easily and finish you, but one on one they aren't too bad. Besides some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stones of Ephemeral Eyes</a>, they collectively drop 3 Chunks of Dragonstone and 3 Chunks of Clearstone.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note that this area leads to the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> Nest mentioned by the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/filthy-man">Filthy Man</a>. If you just charge in, you'll lose a bunch of Ore. But if you wait and come back with the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/god-s-wrath">God's Wrath</a> Miracle&#8230; Just be sure to clear your inventory first, or you'll lose the Ore anyway. You can also pick up a Pure Hardstone and Pure Sharpstone while you are here. Though really the main prize is the hard-to-get Chunks, which you'll need in significant number to upgrade most of your weapons.</li>
                        <li>Alternate Strategy for the 2 Black Phantoms: Run back towards the elevator while the Phantoms chase you. Without waiting for them, raise the elevator. They will run headlong into the pit and die. Note that you won't be able to collect their drops this way. Further, if the Phantoms get aboard the elevator, they will continue attacking while the elevator is being raised. Then, once you reach the top, the Phantoms will back away, never to attack or retaliate.</li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_8">8. This spot is a fatal Pitfall. Avoid it and take the side tunnel instead.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_9">9. A free-floating proximity explosive waits around the blind corner of this tunnel. Peek around the corner to spot it, then sprint through. There will also be a Pickaxe-wielding Lizardman that will ambush you further down. Pick up the Splinters and L. Splinters of Hardstone from the opposite side of the Pitfall before proceeding.<br />
                        <br />
                        As you exit the tunnel into the cavernous area, look up. Near the top is the aforementioned Great Axe. Looking left rom the mouth of the tunnel, you will see a Large Bearbug hanging over a platform and an NPC waving at you. The NPC is <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/patches">Patches, the Hyena</a> and he will offer to let you take the treasure underneath the Bearbug. You have two choices:<br />
                        <br />
                        a. Take Patches' suggestion and take the &quot;treasure&quot; (it's a Club). If you do, the hanging Bearbug will leap down, nearly blocking your path. Patches will taunt you and walk away. There is room just behind the Bearbug to walk out, but if you decide to kill the creature, <em>immediately</em> run back to the end of the platform once its HP reaches zero because it will explode and likely kill you. Patches will be standing on the platform where the Bearbug was originally. Talk to him to receive a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-flame-resistance">Ring of Flame Resistance</a>.<br />
                        <br />
                        b. Ignore Patches. Walk up the ramp and kill the Bearbug. Once the dust is settled, collect the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-flame-resistance">Ring of Flame Resistance</a> lying beside it.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_10">10. Three Rock Worms pop out of the ground and this junction to attack you. Be ready to strike them down.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_11">11. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/filthy-man">Filthy Man</a> is here off the left. If you walk down the pathway here along the rift, flying Bearbugs will rise up from the rift and attack you. Luckily these guys are absolute pushovers. Slash or blast or shoot away until they die. If possible, kill them over solid ground to claim any Dragonstones that they drop.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_12">12. Fog entrance to the tunnel system, turn right at the first junction for a Soul.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_13">13. There is a big Bearbug here in the tunnel. Draw him forward then backtrack and use the side tunnel to bypass him. You can also strike him from behind with impunity if you'd like. Just remember to walk away before he explodes when killed.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_14">14. There is a proximity explosive here. If you drop down there is a possibility that you'll be caught in the blast before you can land and run away. Best to avoid this spot and take the short detour. But while here, look at the map carefully and explore all of the side tunnels. To your left are some Augites of Guidance. To your right is the small lava rift, which is key to getting the items here. Be sure to pull the Bearbug out of the tunnel to the right, so you don't spook the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> inside. Once out in the rift, kill the Bearbugs for lots of Souls, grabbing the Soul from the middle tunnel, then the Dragon Longsword +1 from the far tunnel. The items in the lava are Dragonstones, including a Pure stone and 4 Chunks. But you'll need some high Fire Damage resistance to get them safely (If you are overburden when you try to pick up one of the Dragonstones in the lava and you die, you will not be able to get the stone!). When you are finished here, go to Point <strong>15</strong>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_15">15. This is where the long path and the short path meet, i.e. Point <strong>3</strong> leads you here as well. Drop down to proceed to the boss area. Be on the lookout for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> before you drop as well. Also, once you drop, several Rock Worms will jump out of the ground to attack you. There are also several ladders here that let you climb back up, if you want or need to trek back to the Archstone to return to the Nexus.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_16">16. This fog gate leads to the boss. Before that, look around for the Full Moon Grasses and Stone of Ephemeral Eyes. Also, take the alternate side of the tunnel to get a pair of Hands of God. It is guarded by a trio of Spitting Worms that use a 360 degree splash attack.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_6_17">17. The Flamelurker boss battle. See the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk2-2-boss">Flamelurker</a> link for more information.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_7_1">A surprisingly easy fight, especially after <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk2-2-boss">Flamelurker</a>. The fight will start almost immediately upon entering the Fog Gate at the bottom of a staircase leading from Flamelurker's lair.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_7_2">Be aware that there are two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizards</a> in this section. There is one at the end of the entrance hall on the left and the other is up by the second ballista.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Welcome to map reading hell. This is your starting point, it is in the top center of the map. I'm sure the map is bombarding you with item names left and right. If you see a long list of items in one spot, it is likely a set of starting armor for one of several classes: Magician, Thief, and Knight.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Since the section to the right of the starting point is locked for now, you'll end up at this point. Watch out for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/mind-flayer">Mind Flayer</a> here. These guys have powerful ranged magic spells, and can paralyze you and deliver a fatal blow if you try to melee them from the front. Kill them from afar with arrows or magic, or hide at the end of their patrol routes and attack their backsides when they walk away from you. An extra large weapon can knock them down. Grab the key here to open the cells in this and the adjoining area. You'll get a set of Magician's gear nearby.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">A tunnel leads from Point 2 to this area. Watch out for another guard here, then grab the gate key from the wall. Loot the place then return to the beginning of the map and proceed to point 4.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">With key in hand you can open this gate now and proceed towards point 5. You'll find your first Iron Maidens here. The one in the cell on the left has a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a> in it. There are other items in these cells. The Dreglings imprisoned here aren't too aggressive, and guard three items, so kill them all for some loot. You may get some valuable spice items which will come in handy. In the cell with two Iron Maidens, one has a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/black-leather">Black Leather</a> set from the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief">Thief</a> class.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">This Iron Maiden, and others on this map, marked with a green icon (which means 'poison' in Japanese), are traps. Inside is a live Dregling with a poisoned knife. Open it an you automatically get stabbed. So it is a good idea to have a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/royal-lotus">Royal Lotus</a> in one of your five equipped item slots.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Look out for the guard patrolling here. Once you finish him off, check the dead end spot for your next key. Watch out for that Pitfall across from the key. With it you can open that locked gate in the previous hallway. Watch out for another guard patrolling here. He kills those that rush around this blind corner.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/once-royal-mistress">Once Royal Mistress</a> is singing in a cell here. She functions as the vendor for this map. Unlike other vendors, she won't move from this spot. She sells the cheapest <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fresh-spice">Fresh Spice</a> in the game and is the only vendor selling <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/old-spice">Old Spice</a>. The cell across from her filled with Dreglings is only holding a Soul. If you are confident, fight them, otherwise just ignore them all and leave the cell locked.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">This room with filled with Iron Maidens. The one by itself, marked with that green poison icon, is another trap. But the 3 clumped together contain the Ring of Magical Sharpness(magic spell power increased while magic defense is decreased) and some Souls. Proceed along the stairs. The opposite landing has <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/freke">Sage Freke</a> in it, but he is locked away for now. So go down the semi-hidden stairs descending down between the landings.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Remember the location of these two side gates. They lead to the Jailor's Hall. Grab the key while you are here and proceed onward for now. The floor halfway down the staircase leads to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/lord-rydell">Lord Rydell</a> the NPC. If your World Tendency is Pure White the rubble near him will clear, allowing you to get some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/venerable-sage-s-robe">Venerable Sages</a> armor.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">At this bottom level is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/prisoner-horde">Prisoner Horde</a> enemy to your right. This mass of gray bodies can fire powerful ranged magic at you, but must charge up for a few seconds as a warning for you to hide behind one of the pillars here. If you try melee, a half dozen swords appear around him and he will swing wildly at you. Arrows work really well on him. Be aware that there is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> in the second hallway behind him. Feel free to loot the cells here. But be wary of the pitfall on the eastern hallway, and of the full set of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fluted-armor">Fluted Armor</a> in that same hallway. If you take the first hallway after the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/prisoner-horde">Prisoner Horde</a>, you will find a pile of coffins and debris in one corner. Break through that to get to a hidden doorway that leads outside. Down the stairs on the left you'll find some a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-moon">Shard of Moonlightstone</a>. Still outside, around the hallway to the right you'll find an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/estoc">Estoc</a> on a dead soldier.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">This gate can be opened with a key from <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk3-2">3-2</a> that requires Pure White <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/world-tendency">World Tendency</a>. Just ignore it for now. <strong>*NOTE</strong>* see obtaining the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dull-rat-s-ring">Dull Rat's Ring</a> from <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/lord-rydell">Lord Rydell</a> in <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk3-1">3-1</a> as this unlocks the door to the second floor.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Avoid running through the arrow walkway as it can be shut off by taking a detour through the Jailor's Hallway<sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-1" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. Speaking of which, grab the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/prison-of-hope-warden-s-key">Warden's Key</a> from the end of the arrow walkway. Also, you can drop onto the small pathways on either side of the main walkway. One has a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a>. The other has a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/rapier#toc3">Mercury Rapier +1</a>. In getting both of the above items, you can return to the main platform by walking on the ledge until you reach the spot where there is an opening on the fence (one for each item).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Return to the Jailor's Hallway. Open the gates, either one works, and head on through. Watch out for the two guards at the far ends. Each side has an item as well. Once outside you'll walk through a staircase. If you climb to the top and follow the path to the end you'll get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/silver-catalyst">Silver Catalyst</a>. While your spells will be at their weakest with this wand, it increases your MP capacity by 20%(which stacks with the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/silver-coronet">Silver Coronet</a> you should have picked up along the way through this level).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Push the lever on the backside of the statue to shut it off. You can loot the arrow walkway now. Among the loot is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/clever-rat-s-ring">Clever Rat's Ring</a>, which boosts your attack power when your current health is 30% of maximum or less.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Take this second staircase before approaching the boss. There are <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/widow-s-lotus">Widow's Lotuses</a> that you can grab by dropping down onto that little ledge halfway down the raised catwalk. But they are a trap of sorts. There is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/baby-s-nail">Baby's Nail</a> wielding Black Phantom below this area with a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> equipped. She is invisible outside of lock-on range. If you grab the Lotuses and drop, you'll likely catch a crossbow bolt to the face for your troubles as you land.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">Be wary of the Liar. This Dregling is the one you would have been warned about if you went directly to the boss. Despite his pleas of not interfering, he fuels the spell that revives the Fool's Idol. Kill him to beat the boss. Grab the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/special-key">Special Key</a> while you are here. Feel free to backtrack to point 17 to release <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/freke">Sage Freke</a> now.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1"><a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/freke">Sage Freke</a> waits here, and releasing him nets you a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/geri-s-stiletto">Geri's Stiletto</a> (MP absorption from enemies attacked) and lets you learn some higher level Magic by trading Demon Souls.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_8_1">An invisible <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-babys-nail">Baby's Nail wielding Black Phantom</a>. Melee attacks can cause plague.

                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_1">Your starting point. Despite the likelihood of you falling to your death here a few times by mistake, at least you can read the map easily enough. <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a>s will try to ambush you on this map. Sometimes dropping out of the darkness overhead, and other times pretending to be statues along the path. Look for pairs of glowing red eyes to identify them before you approach.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_2">The left path leads to a Soul, and you will return to this spot later in the level. For now take the right path, but watch out for the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> ambush. On the next round platform there is a corpse on the backside of the torch sconce which has 6 <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables#toc1">Fresh Spice</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_3">A <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> drops from the sky as you approach the tower. If you turn right and follow that path you can find a bunch of items, including a lot of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-moon">Moonlightstones</a>. Point 18 is here too, so remember this spot. When you are done, return to the inside of the tower and go clockwise to ascend the stairs.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_4">This little balcony is where you drop off to get the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/rune-sword">Rune Sword</a> and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/rune-shield">Rune Shield</a>. There are usually Messages or Bloodstains on the ground here if you play online. Take a small step out and aim for the walkway 20 feet below you. After you pick up the items you can step off onto the walkway back to the entrance. Continuing past point 4, as you approach the walkway, look up to find a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> attempting to ambush you from above. As you approach the area of Point 5, you can walk onto that leaning tower and get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/flamberge">Flamberge</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_5">You will be ambushed by multiple <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a>s along this walkway. Some even wait for you to pass and will ambush you from behind if you just blindly sprint along.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_6">Before you climb up this tower, you can walk along that small lip on the outside, trigger the fog gate first to be safe. If you go a small distance to the right you will pick up some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables#toc1">spice</a>. Halfway up the tower a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> will ambush you. Despite the strange camera angles here, remember that you can block his attacks without much trouble. You can also blast him with <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/soul-arrow">Soul Arrow</a>, using some of the free <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables#toc1">spice</a> you found to keep yourself ready for a fight. Step past the elevator that lowers down to pick up a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a>, then go on up. Be prepared to fight a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> when you get to the top.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_7">Kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dregling">Dregling</a>s here to snap one of the chains holding up that giant heart. Also, if you have <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/world-tendency">PURE White World Tendency</a>, you can climb the stairs here and a bridge will be repaired. This is where you get the key to free <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/lord-rydell">Lord Rydell</a> in <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk3-1">3-1</a>, and to open the eastern hallway at point 11 in 3-1. When you wish you proceed, go down the staircase. You'll need to climb into those little cages to get lowered down to the Blood Swamp. Or, drop down to Point 8 to meet <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/yurt">Yurt, the Silent Chief</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_8">Now that you dropped down here, the way to proceed is to let <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/yurt">Yurt, the Silent Chief</a> go free. While he is evil, feel free to ignore him for now. If you do fight him and he falls, the next time you enter this area his armor will be found in a bag near this area. If you simply quit and reload your save, his armor will appear in front of his cage and you don't need to exit the level and lose progress. Once you beat a boss after freeing and not killing him, he will show up on the second floor landing of the Nexus, that flat empty floor just above the Archstones. He'll start assassinating people if left alone. But kill him right away and you get two free Souls from new corpses added to the Nexus. You can also grab his <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gloom-armor">Gloom Armor</a> there without worrying about weight; just talk to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stockpile-thomas">Stockpile Thomas</a> and return to the second floor landing to get the rest. After you free him, take his cage down to the Blood Swamp.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Warning:</strong> If you attack <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/yurt">Yurt</a> with either magic or range weapons without first talking to him, he will turn hostile. This means you <strong>cannot</strong> talk to him and therefore lose the opportunity to free him and take the cage down. You will effectively be stranded, since Yurts cage is the only way to proceed safely from this location. You will need to restart the level. Either <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/evacuate">Evacuate</a>, use the nearby <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shard-of-archstone">Shard of Archstone</a> or suicide. When you next run the level, use the cage which precedes the drop onto Yurts location to continue.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_9">There is another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/prisoner-horde">Prisoner Horde</a> in this area of the Blood Swamp. Fight him the same as the other one. Just hide behind one of the pillars nearby and trade ranged shots. Be wary of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/man-centipede-giant">Giant Man Centipede</a>s as well. Not only do they have a jumping tackle that can break your guard, but when they split from their tail they spew vile junk on you that needs to be healed with a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables">Lotus</a>. Get the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/fragrant-ring">Fragrant Ring</a> to the west of this point for MP Regeneration.

If you spook the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> and he falls to his death, you can backtrack to the walkway leading up to Point 11 and pick up the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/upgrade-moon">Moonlightstones</a> (Chunk and Pure) from his corpse. Also, notice that you can walk between the two tentacles at this point for some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/old-spice">Old Spice</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_14">As you walk past this wall, be wary of a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Crossbow Gargoyle</a> flying on your right side. He may kill you if you walk along blindly.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_15">Pick up the soul on this tower than wait, and wait, and possibly wait some more for the express elevator to show up. As you ride up it, be ready for the ambushing <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> at the top. Raise your shield and boldly step off the elevator ready to fight.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_16">This is the second chain tower. As before, kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dregling">Dreglings</a> casting the spell to keep the chain intact. The heart should now collapse, opening the way to the boss, and to a nice treasure cache.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_17">Be wary of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gargoyle">Gargoyle</a> who attacks from the darkness as you get ready to approach the end of this walkway. Once you drop down, you are near the beginning of the level again. Be wary of new <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/man-centipede-giant">Giant Man Centipede</a>s released from the destroyed heart.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_18">Enter the now-crushed heart tower and go right and proceed down the stairs outside to reach this point, being careful of the new <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/man-centipede-giant">Giant Man Centipedes</a> . Take a counter-clockwise path through this inner area. This puts you behind a number of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/man-centipede-giant">Giant Man Centipede</a> inside. For your troubles you get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-avarice">Ring of Avarice</a> a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gold-mask">Gold Mask</a>, an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/epee-rapier">Epee Rapier</a>, and some Souls and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/old-spice">Old Spice</a> and a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stone-of-ephemeral-eyes">Stone of Ephemeral Eyes</a>. When done, return to the previous area and climb the tower again.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_19">This time you can keep going clockwise and climb a free-hanging staircase. There is a Renowned Hero's soul behind the staircase. The lip on the outside protects you from falling off on that side, but the inside is open and treacherous.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_20">There is another Black Phantom <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/mind-flayer">Mind Flayer</a> here. Wait for him to approach then turn his back. Sprint forward and attack him with melee or ranged attacks. Run away before he turns around completely. Sprint down the stairs a bit and, when he stops running and begins looking left and right, get ready to double back. Once he turns away again, repeat the process until he dies.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_21">Behind the stairs at the top is a Storied Hero's soul. This fog gate leads to the boss. But first, go past it for lots of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/old-spice">Old Spice</a>. This will fuel any Magic buffs you want to use for the bosses. Also, double back above the staircase you just climbed to get a Soul.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_9_22">The fog gate opens onto Maneater. See the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk3-2-boss">Maneater</a> page for more information.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="#">Maneater Archstone</a><span id="playthrough_totals_10"></span></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_10_1">1. The Maneater Archstone and your starting point for this level. If you've been through Stonefang then know this is a relatively short level as well, basically just consisting of the boss. In any case, grab the valuable Souls in front of you and begin your climb.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_10_2">2. Plenty of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/man-centipede">Man Centipedes</a> dwell on the stairs here. However, the real threats are the two Black Phantom Mind Flayers that patrol the stairs. Unlike 3-2, the walls obscure any vision of them, so tread very carefully as you climb and be wary of footsteps. They also have considerably more HP than before, so be wary of that too. Use the same hit and run tactics as you did in 3-2 and you should be fine. To avoid death by soul arrow, you can run backwards since the staircase is curved and it won't hit you. Wait for them to turn around and go stab them in the back and rinse and repeat.<br />
                        <br />
                        Alternate Strategy: Equip a bow and the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/graverobber-s-ring">Graverobber's Ring</a>. Get to where you can just auto-target them with R3. Keep shooting your bow until they are about to cast soul arrow. Roll immediately to dodge the spell. Rinse and repeat.<br />
                        <br />
                        Alternate Strategy: Cast Anti-Magic Field and hack and slash until they die. You may also use Dark Silver Shield as a back up to make sure you get close enough to affect them.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_10_3">3. The final fog door, leading to the boss Old Monk. If you've witnessed a cutscene by this point and are playing online then you will be most likely facing another player (given that they didn't leave) Some players will let you kill them, however most will fight to the death as it is very satisfying to kill another player. A <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> sits at the top of the stairs, just behind the second Mind Flayer.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_10_4">4. The Old Monk demon boss. See the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk3-3-boss">Old Monk</a> page for more information.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_1">1.Your starting position. Note the green markers on the map, these are the pressure plate traps, while the dotted green lines are the trajectories of the bolts fired when the trap is triggered. When you first walk forward you will see a Silver Skeleton rise. These guys roll around a lot, and can hurt you with the spikes on their bodies. Watch out for their overhead guard breaker attack and forward thrust attack. Both have a pause before being unleashed, so back up. They are weak to Blunt damage. Magic works alright as well. Note the healing Grasses on the backside of the gate. Also, if you look closely you can see <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/satsuki">Satsuki</a> standing above the gate. He'll come down with White Tendency, or come down as a Black Phantom with Black Tendency.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_2">2. Advance slowly along this staircase so that you do not draw the attention of more than one rolling Skeleton. Also, the archer here fires magical arrows. So do not block too many shots with basic shields, dodge instead. Occasionally these archers will drop the powerful Holy Arrows for you.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_3">3. There are several items in this area, a Talisman of God, a Soul, and some Lotuses to stop any Bleeding you incur from the enemies here. Be wary of the two archers on top of the fog gate. Shoot them with arrows or magic, or proceed through the gate and come back for them.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_4">4. &quot;Hey Ugly, I know you!&quot; The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk4-1-vanguard">tutorial boss</a> makes his sad, much weaker return. The same tactics apply. Stay behind him with melee and use your better weapons to crush him. Alternatively, he won't move from this spot if you attack him from the edge of lock-on range with any type of projectile. Also, there is at least one Manta/Storm Beast that flies overhead and might attack you. So kill it first if you don't want to get blindsided by a giant barb.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_5">5. The green marker and dotted line denote the first pressure plate trap that you can encounter on this map. Stepping on the plate releases a series of 3 metal bolts down the middle of the hallway. Hug the wall and you should be alright. Raise your shield just to be safe. Turn towards your left if you want some treasure and are confident that you can best or evade the enemy there, otherwise climb the stairs.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_6">6. Before you can claim your Crescent Falchion +1(MP regen and magic damage when attacking) you must face the Black Samurai Skeleton. This bugger is tough, uses combination attacks, deals a lot of damage, and can break your guard. Projectiles are recommended for dealing with this threat. Otherwise lure him towards the stairs, climbing up them yourself, then dropping back down when he follows. Grab the items out here and you can drop to the starting pathway below you to evade him. You can also kill him from point 2 by using a bow, he will squirm around so it may take quite a few arrows to finish the job.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_7">7. This point is at the top of the staircase near points 5 and 6. Note the Silver Skeleton up here on the right. He will attack as you get up to this top landing. Beat him and proceed down this walkway.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_8">8. This spot, besides leading down to the Copper Key to free <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blige">Blige</a>, is the shortcut to get the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/regenerator-s-ring">Regenerator's Ring</a>. Roll off the top towards the broken wall to get early access to the ring. However&#8230; this area puts you right before the boss, and you cannot return due to a fog gate that faces the opposite side. So you either have to fight the boss, use Evacuate or a Shard of Archstone, or suicide, or wait and come around the legitimate way.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_9">9. There is another pressure plate trap here. Carefully walk around it to avoid unleashing a hailstorm of bolts. Grab the Copper Key by the closed gate here, as it will let you free Graverobber Blige elsewhere in this level, your best source for many kinds of arrows.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_10">10. Travel along the other side and you'll drop under an archer Silver Skeleton and go into a tunnel. A Silver Skeleton will attack after you round the corner, and there is another in a small staircase to the right of the next room. This staircase leads to a seeming dead-end. But that green line marks an illusionary wall. It looks like an archway with wavering stones. Attack it to open the archway. But going from this direction leads to a double ambush. So leave it alone for now.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_11">11. As you climb the other set of stairs towards this point, a Silver Skeleton will ambush you along the way. Usually this guy rolls harmlessly over your head and lands with his back facing you. Get in a critical strike, or just bash/slash away until he dies. This outside area is the 'Give me shiny, Give my sparkly' <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crow">Crow</a>. Check out the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crow">Crow</a> page for a list of trades. Drop a single desired item(a single quantity of that item only), to which the crow will respond verbally in the positive, and leave the map(or quit game and reload). The new item will be available for pick-up at the right side of the tree, behind an upraised root. Also, you can drop off the side here to hunt that Crystal Gecko. The item is a Stone of Ephemeral Eyes.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_12">12. This spot leads towards that double ambush mentioned in point 10. I suggest going back outside to where the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk4-1-vanguard">Vanguard</a> 'tutorial' boss was and dropping down into the open pit in the ground. Attack the illusionary archway there and you will be at the end of the tunnel, behind one of the ambushers.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_13">13. Use the Copper Key here to unlock <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blige">Graverobber Blige</a>. This vendor sells lots of arrows. You can also purchase basic Leather Armor here, which has a decent defense to weight ratio.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_14">14. If you took my advice and dropped down the pit behind the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk4-1-vanguard">Vanguard</a>, you'll end up at this point(or if you are exiting via this path after beating the double ambush). There is a pressure plate trap here, so hug the left wall again to avoid the arrows.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_15">15. Before going through the fog gate and climbing the staircase to this point, look to the left to get some Shards of Cloudstone and Soul. Once you've looted this area, climb on up. Notice the ladder on your left. You can climb this to get some items, cross that wooden plank up here to get to the rest. Also, there is a Black Skeleton to your left as you approach the Silver Skeletons. He guards an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/adjudicator-s-shield">Adjudicator's Shield</a>. This shield blocks 90% of melee damage and 50% of magic damage. But, more importantly, it regenerates your HP when equipped, just as a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/regenerator-s-ring">Regenerator's Ring</a> or Blessed weapon would.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_16">16. There is a pressure plate trap here, but the bolts come from behind you. You can also roll off the wooden plank after the top of the ladder mentioned in point 15 to avoid this plate altogether. Also, before you drop down completely toward the pathway below, hug the wall on the right and you will find a Soul.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_17">17. A somewhat tricky spot. Around this blind corner is your first Golden Skeleton encounter. These guys carry massive two-handed cleavers, meaning that they don't flinch from small melee attacks. Their Golden status makes them resistant to weapons as well. Magic damage tears through them easily enough though. Also, there is a Manta/Storm Beast here, flying overhead, that will attack you several times as it passes by on patrol.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_18">18. This room is the last major junction before approaching the boss. First you want to climb the stairs here. As you come back around you'll notice an item on a small side section, with a wooden beam leading towards it. This is the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/graverobber-s-ring">Graverobber's Ring</a>, which partially hides you from Black Phantoms(very important if you play with <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/world-tendency">Black World Tendency</a>). You can walk through the broken wall up here to get a Soul as well. This second doorway is the 'intended' path towards the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/regenerator-s-ring">Regenerator's Ring</a>, and to a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a>. So you might as well grab the ring if you haven't already. Look out for one last pressure plate trap as well.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_19">19. The last obstacle before you reach the boss. There is a Black Skeleton here, at the bottom of the stairs. This long hallway practically begs for you to use projectiles on him. Feel free to let him chase you a bit, as you can run to Point 18 to escape.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_11_20">20. The Adjudicator boss. See the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/walk4-1-boss">Adjudicator</a> link for more information.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_1">1. This is your starting point. Because the Storm Beasts in this level are hard to hit at times, try equipping a Thief's Ring to avoid detection.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_2">2. If you'd like, you can attack the Storm Beast in front of you here. Also, either side of the platform is hiding an item. A Stone of Ephemeral Eyes and a Soul.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_3">3.<a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blige">Graverobber Blige</a> has set up shop here. Be sure to look at his expanded inventory. With the easy <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a> conveniently located nearby, you can grab a few thousand soul points and use them for a small shopping spree.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_4">4.There are <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurkers</a> near this point. These guys respawn when killed as long as the Reaper lives. But, after killing them you can shoot arrows down at the Reaper from here. Lucky for you <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/blige">Graverobber Blige</a> sells Wooden Arrows for 5 soul a pop. You'll need a handful to take down the Reaper. Look to your left for 11 free Kunai (throwing daggers that can cause Poison).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_5">5.If you like, use this spot as a shortcut to get down. Aim for the altar below and you take only the smallest amount of damage. You can also use the altar as a shield of sorts if you wish to fight the Reaper at melee range.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_6">6.To either side of the altar are doorways leading to a small room with <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/patches">Patches, the Hyena</a><sup class="footnoteref"><a id="footnoteref-1" href="javascript:;" class="footnoteref" onclick="WIKIDOT.page.utils.scrollToReference('footnote-1')">1</a></sup>. The Augites of Guidance light up this room as well. He'll tell you to look into the nearby pit to see a treasure. Despite this being one of his lame traps, you get some good stuff by doing so.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_7">7. This is the room you fall into. First thing first, sprint forward as you land! There is an <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-uchigatana">Uchigatana wielding Black Phantom</a> behind you! If you have a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> equipped, he will likely ignore you for now though. Walk forward and talk to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/urbain">Saint Urbain</a>. Loot the items here. For the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-uchigatana">Uchigatana Black Phantom</a>, moving clockwise works well. After he swings, he will expose his back to you if you move in that direction. The treasure on the stalagmite is the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/makoto">Magic Sword &quot;Makoto&quot;</a> that <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/satsuki">Satsuki</a> is looking for, but it requires <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/world-tendency">White Tendency</a> to drop. When done, climb up the staircase behind where the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/bp-uchigatana">Uchigatana Black Phantom</a> once was. <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/urbain">Saint Urbain</a> will appear in the Nexus once you leave this area now. Talk to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/patches">Patches</a> to get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-gash-resistance">Ring of Gash Resistance</a> for your troubles.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_8">8.There is another one of those illusionary archways here, midway up the stairs on the left. This leads to a super-leveled <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/black-skeleton">Black Skeleton</a> wielding dual Katanas. He can kill you in one or two hits in most instances, so be extra cautious. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> out here is one of the more annoying ones to catch, as he tends to suicide off the cliff before you can reach him. Keep climbing the cliff side out here and you will get the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/white-bow">White Bow</a> and 18 <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/white-arrow">White Arrows</a>.<br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="color: green">Tip</span> If you're patient, there's an easy way to kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard</a> here. Stand near the edge of the cliff where you fought the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/black-skeleton">Black Skeleton</a> and look towards the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizard's</a> location. You should be able to see it hiding in the grass. Aim with your bow and fire off an arrow. Upon taking damage, it will dart off in the opposite direction, but it will not run; instead, it will just return to its original position. Continue with this strategy for an easy defeat. You shouldn't even need the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> equipped, either.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_9">9. A pressure switch is behind the altar here, which opens the door at point 10.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_10">10. This door is opened with the pressure switch at point 9.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_11">11. Again, the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> will prevent the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/storm-beast">Storm Beast</a> from attacking you in most instances. You can see 3 <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/silver-skeleton">Silver Skeletons</a> below. Try luring them out one at a time with arrows. If you have trouble, climb the small step back near Point 10 and hit them with ranged attacks. Usually enemies will not climb these steps (although that is not true 100% of the time). If you're having trouble with the gold skeletons or BP skeletons, it's possible to lure them up to these steps as well.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_12">12. There are 2 <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/gold-skeleton">Gold Skeletons</a> here. You can lure them out one at a time with arrows from that little balcony just before this point. Pick up the Soul after beating them and proceed towards the next cave entrance. You can also run past them and into the cave (they won't follow you).</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_13">13. Now this map is starting to pick up. After you enter this cave you'll see a walkway leading to a staircase, wrapping around this room. There is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> here who fires a powerful sweeping magic beam attack at you. Quickly rush him and fight him at melee to avoid taking too many hits. Using a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/dark-silver-shield">Dark Silver Shield</a> will also completely negate the beam damage. [You can roll below the beams and even be below <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> itself 99% of the time quite safely]. With him dead, proceed to the next corner. Note where he respawns here. Kill him again. Now pull out your bow and look to the lower landing to your left, with all of the pillars. Look on the right side of the landing for a pair of yellowish eyes. Shoot some arrows at this <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a> to lure him out onto the middle of the landing. Keep firing until he either dies, or the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> respawns. If the former, get ready to walk on down, otherwise swap out and melee the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a>.<br />

                        With the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/thief-s-ring">Thief's Ring</a> equipped head a bit toward the walkway until you can see the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> (Take note where the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> was standing). Snipe the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> . When it is dealt with, hurry to the spot it was standing at and go into sniper view. Look down and in between the columns you should see the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a>, snipe it as quick as possible before the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> returns to this spot.<br />

                        Bring ~10 <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/soul-remains">Soul Remains</a> with you. When you enter the cave on the right side below should see the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a> . Toss some <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/soul-remains">Soul Remains</a> down behind the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a> . He will try to hit it with his Scythe, fall down and die. Though you may need a little practice to toss it right behind him.<br />

                        If you're confident that you can take down a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a> in one series of attacks, and you've figured out where the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a> is, you can get through the room quickly by simply dashing from <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> to <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> until you can turn the corner to face the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a>. You should be close enough that you can take him down before he can start any attacks.<br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>- or -</strong><br />
                        <br />
                        With a bow and some arrows, walk towards the 2nd column on your right on the first bridge. Turn around and locate the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/reaper">Reaper</a>. Since you cannot target him nor aim your bow low enough to hit him, you must manually aim over your shoulder and hit him with your bow. Pick a spot directly above the reaper on the wall in front of you, and lower your camera until you are aiming at him. You may miss a couple of times, and every time you do hit him he will walk a few steps out of position, then walk right back.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_14">14. This is the general area where the Reaper hangs out. Note how close he is to the cliff here. Folks to engage in melee sometimes fall off while attacking him. If you melee him once, he should fall off of the cliff and perish. If you can survive to the end of the level, he actually falls into Old Hero's crypt, allowing you to pick up whatever darkmoon stone or scythe he may have dropped.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_15">15. As you walk across this landing, a totally invisible(for now) female <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a> spawns behind you, giggling. Run to the other end of the landing and turn around with your shield raised to avoid a fatal <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/controls#backstab">backstab</a>. Once her attack rebounds off your shield she will be visible. Fight her like a regular <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/shadowlurker">Shadowlurker</a>, just a bit faster.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_16">16. You will see two items in this natural cell room. They are merely Crescent Grass laid out as a trap. If you approach, two female Shadowlurkers appear behind you again. Avoid this spot and proceed onward, or stand near the wall with your shield raised until you have blocked both fatal strikes and they have become visible. Kill them and proceed onward.<br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="color: green">Tip</span> If you backtrack to the location of the two Gold Skeletons outside the fog-gate at point 12, these two female Shadowlurkers should be visible once you get back here.//</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_17">17. The last Reaper is hiding by the purple Shadowlurker here, hidden around the corner. Notice that you set yourself up for a pincer attack here. You have a few options: use a Poison Cloud spell on the purple Shadowlurker and you should catch the Reaper as well, shoot the purpleShadowlurkerwith arrows, then lure out the Reaper and do the same, or kill the purple Shadowlurker and try to sprint past the Reaper using the open spot where the Shadowlurker once stood. No more Reapers.<br />
                        <br />
                        <span style="color: green">Tip</span> To deal with this Reaper, simply return to where the second Reaper was located and head back to the staircase. If you look below, the Reaper should be visible and easy to snipe off. (Reaper will not be visible unless you pass the entrance leading to the outside below, once a fog path)</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_12_18">18. Look at this room closely. Notice those white balls floating about? Remember the proximity explosives of 2-2? Yeah. Watch their patterns, then bait their explosions by dashing towards one and retreating. Or, if you've got the running space for it, simply dash right through one. Also, the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/slug">Phosphorescent Slugs</a> here can team up on you if you fall in the wrong spot. Do kill them though, as they provide <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/consumables">Sticky White Stuff</a> for your weapon. You can also get a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/hiltless">Hiltless</a> katana and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ronin-s-ring">Ronin's Ring</a> from that little room off to the right. I suggest looping back around from the far side passage. This puts you behind most of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/slug">slugs</a>.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_13_1">1. Your starting position. More than ever, the Thief's Ring is highly recommended. If you like using magic, try equipping the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/kris-blade">Kris Blade</a> and <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-magical-sharpness">Ring of Magical Sharpness</a> here as well(the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/insanity-catalyst">Insanity Catalyst</a> can be helpful as well).</li>

Unlike the other zones, here they attack and make a berserker rush toward your character. You can hit them with melee weapons when they do. This behavior is intended to allow melee characters without ranged attacks to kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/storm-beast">Storm Beast</a> in order to fight the Storm King. Although the Stormruler Sword works well enough&#8230;</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_13_3">3. This nook is a safe zone, protecting you from the boss and most of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/storm-beast">Storm Beast</a>.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_13_4">4. After you kill 10 or so <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/storm-beast">Storm Beast</a>, the boss descends towards the ground to fight you. He fires a series of giant pointed barbs at you every time he passes by. Make sure you are hiding behind something wide when he does this. Then step out and attack him repeatedly.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_13_5">5. The <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/crystal-lizards">Crystal Lizards</a> here carry Darkmoon Stones, including Pure Ore. Also, the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stormruler">Stormruler</a> Sword is here, the one mentioned in the developer placed note says, &quot;You'll need a sword that can tear the sky.&quot; This sword can fell multiple <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/storm-beast">Storm Beast</a> in one swing, and can be used to attack the boss as he passes.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_13_6">6. This is the other safe zone of the match. You are protected from <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/storm-beast">Storm Beast</a> and the boss while standing here. Once his barbs hit the house, step out and start swinging that <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/stormruler">Stormruler</a> or casting Magic. Once he is defeated, be sure to pick up the Chunks of Cloudstone on the right side of the area. This rare item is necessary for forging a +5 'Dark' shield for the Cloudstone Trophy. There are some more Holy Arrows out here as well.<br />

(WARNING: If you are not careful, the attacks of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> can kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/filthy-woman">Filthy Woman</a> vendor)</li>

Alternatively, the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> hiding at the end of the bridge can be sniped with a Bow from the area just before the bridge.

Once you snipe the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> he will come for you, but his path will blocked by the flaming ones on the bridge.

                    <li data-id="playthrough_15_12">12. After you pass this point, two <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> will drop down behind you as an ambush. Be prepared for them.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_15_13">13. With White Tendency a ladder appears here. Climb up, killing any <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> near the top. Then go right, and look across the bridge to the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a>. Shoot him with arrows to draw him out, and head back towards the ladder to fight him safely. Then climb up this room, and look at the three <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved Ones</a> guarding the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/istarelle">Istarelle</a> holy pole arm. Lure them with arrows one at a time. Also, look down from this spot and you'll see the Leechmonger's boss area far below you.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_15_14">14. There is a <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> here, as well as several in the room behind him. If you need to, lure him back into the room with the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/rat">rats</a> and climb the ramps there. He cannot pull himself up the waist-high parts like you can. So attack him with ease. (WARNING: If you are not careful, the attacks of the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> can kill the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/filthy-woman">Filthy Woman</a> vendor)</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_15_15">15. There is another <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> here behind some regular <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a>. Lure the small ones out first, then take on the big guy. The big guy doesn't turn very well, so try to get behind him if you rush him head-on. Alternatively, the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> hiding at the end of the bridge can be sniped with a Bow from the area just before the bridge. You can do this without alerting the two Flame Pole wielding <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> between you and him. Once you snipe the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a> he will come for you, but his path will blocked by the flaming ones on the bridge. Just keep plugging away at the <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/giant-depraved-ones">Giant Depraved One</a>, then take out the other two.</li>

                    <li data-id="playthrough_16_1">1. Head forward. Once you've passed through the fog, you'll enter a vast cavern. <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> are scattered around, praying to the Maiden. They'll ignore you; even if you kill them, so if you're feeling vicious then go for it. You'll see a narrow path to your left. Follow it until the second plateau and do a little reconnaissance. There should be a small squad of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> in front of you and a wood platform with a sheer drop past it to your right.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_16_2">2. Here's where you need to be careful. You need to drop off the platform into the water to face the demon - well, actually, the demon's bodyguard, but we'll get to that in a minute - but the water's full of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/plague-baby">Plague Babies</a>. They move faster than you and will surround you really quickly. If you just jump off without knowing where you're going, you're plague-ridden toast.</li>
                    <li data-id="playthrough_16_3">3. Smash a couple of <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> off the cliff. You probably won't kill them in one hit, but you'll hit them into the water and give the babies something else to chase. Get two or three in there, then get on the wooden platform and jump to your right. As soon as you hit the swamp, look forward and to the left. You should see a stone pathway leading up to your left and slightly behind you. Run to that as fast as you can. Once you're off the swamp and safely on the stone, keep going. <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/garl-vinland">Garl Vinland</a> is chasing you, but he won't go too far up the pathway, so you can stop here, heal, and use your <a href="http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/widow-s-lotus">Widow's Lotus</a> if necessary.</li>

                <h2>Help</h2>

                <h3>Is this a guide?</h3>
                <p>
                    Nope, not really. This is a set of checklists and information that you can use while playing Dark
                    Souls to make sure you don't miss an item, action, conversation or boss. If you need playthroughs
                    then you can click on the links scattered throughout the page to find them in the wiki.
                </p>

                <h3>Do I need to follow the playthrough in this exact order?</h3>
                <p>
                    Dark Souls is not a liner game and has multiple ways of progressing. This is generally the way I
                    like to play through the game, so feel free to follow it if you like or mix it up. You can always
                    jump back and forth and check things off in a different order.
                </p>

                <h3>Can I use this for multiple characters?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yup, use the profile selector and buttons at the top right of the page to setup multiple
                    characters.
                </p>

                <h3>Your level ranges are all wrong!</h3>
                <p>
                    Any time I mention a level range it is just a rough guideline. The level an area or boss should
                    be attempted at depends a lot on the experience of the player, their skill level and their gear.
                </p>

                <h3>How do I help with feedback, corrections, suggestions or additions?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can post in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/12mj8c/dark_souls_cheat_sheet/">this Reddit thread</a>
                    or if you know your way about Git/GitHub then fork
                    <a href="https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-cheat-sheet/tree/gh-pages">my repo</a> and
                    submit a pull request.
                </p>

                <h3>How does the checklist status get saved?</h3>
                <p>
                    It gets saved to the local storage in your browser and not to any database or API. So if you are
                    clearing your browser cache make sure not to delete the site data or your checklists will
                    get reset. At some point in the future I might hook it up to an API.
                </p>

                <h3>What else have you got planned?</h3>
                <p>
                    Every area in the game is now covered but I'm going to add other bits of information that I think
                    might be useful as you do a playthrough. I'm also aware that the formatting needs a bit of work on
                    mobile devices.
