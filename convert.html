<li data-id="playthrough_16_1">Head forward. Once you've passed through the fog, you'll enter a vast cavern. <a href="/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> are scattered around, praying to the Maiden. They'll ignore you; even if you kill them, so if you're feeling vicious then go for it. You'll see a narrow path to your left. Follow it until the second plateau and do a little reconnaissance. There should be a small squad of <a href="/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> in front of you and a wood platform with a sheer drop past it to your right.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_16_2">Here's where you need to be careful. You need to drop off the platform into the water to face the demon - well, actually, the demon's bodyguard, but we'll get to that in a minute - but the water's full of <a href="/plague-baby">Plague Babies</a>. They move faster than you and will surround you really quickly. If you just jump off without knowing where you're going, you're plague-ridden toast.</li>
<li data-id="playthrough_16_3">Smash a couple of <a href="/depraved-ones">Depraved Ones</a> off the cliff. You probably won't kill them in one hit, but you'll hit them into the water and give the babies something else to chase. Get two or three in there, then get on the wooden platform and jump to your right. As soon as you hit the swamp, look forward and to the left. You should see a stone pathway leading up to your left and slightly behind you. Run to that as fast as you can. Once you're off the swamp and safely on the stone, keep going. <a href="/garl-vinland">Garl Vinland</a> is chasing you, but he won't go too far up the pathway, so you can stop here, heal, and use your <a href="/widow-s-lotus">Widow's Lotus</a> if necessary.</li>
<ul>
    <li data-id="playthrough_15_1"><strong>Alternative strategy</strong></li>
    <li data-id="playthrough_15_1">Just follow the path to your left, you will completely avoid the <a href="/plague-baby">Plague Babies</a> and reach <a href="/garl-vinland">Garl Vinland</a> safely. No need to step into the plague water. Fight him at point <strong>4</strong> on the <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/kouryakubo/ds_en/chart/chart053.html" target="_blank">map</a></li>
